# CVE-2025-44005: Step CA Has Authorization Bypass in ACME and SCEP
# Affects: smallstep/certificates < v0.29.0
# Status: Fixed in our step-ca image via PR #189 (bump to v0.29.0)
# Impact: Other images (alertmanager, caddy, grafana, loki, mosquitto, prometheus)
#         include this library through their upstream base images.
#         We cannot fix this until upstream releases new versions.
# Mitigation: Only step-ca uses ACME functionality in our deployment.
#             The vulnerability is an authorization bypass, not RCE.

CVE-2025-44005

# CVE-2024-45337: golang.org/x/crypto/ssh: Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback
# Affects: golang.org/x/crypto < v0.31.0
# Status: Upstream issue - Atlantis uses older Go toolchain with vulnerable crypto
# Impact: Atlantis image includes multiple Go binaries (terraform, git-lfs, etc.)
#         with this vulnerability in their compiled dependencies.
#         We cannot fix this until Atlantis upstream releases a new version.
# Mitigation: Atlantis does not expose SSH server functionality using this code path.
#             The vulnerability requires malicious server configuration.
# Track: https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases

# CVE-2024-24790: golang: net/netip: Unexpected behavior from Is methods for IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
# Affects: Go stdlib < 1.21.11 / 1.22.4
# Status: Upstream issue - Atlantis is built with Go 1.22.1
# Impact: Atlantis image contains binaries compiled with older Go runtime.
#         We cannot fix this until Atlantis upstream rebuilds with newer Go.
# Mitigation: This is an edge case in IPv6 handling, low practical impact
#             for Atlantis which primarily handles Terraform/OpenTofu operations.
