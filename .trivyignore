# CVE-2025-44005: Step CA Has Authorization Bypass in ACME and SCEP
# Affects: smallstep/certificates < v0.29.0
# Status: Fixed in our step-ca image via PR #189 (bump to v0.29.0)
# Impact: Other images (alertmanager, caddy, grafana, loki, mosquitto, prometheus)
#         include this library through their upstream base images.
#         We cannot fix this until upstream releases new versions.
# Mitigation: Only step-ca uses ACME functionality in our deployment.
#             The vulnerability is an authorization bypass, not RCE.
